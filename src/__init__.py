"""
Runtime-py-core: Python implementation of the workflow runtime core.

This package provides a workflow runtime engine for executing workflows
defined as directed graphs of nodes. It supports various node types,
including start, end, LLM, condition, and loop nodes.

The package is organized into the following layers:
- API: External interfaces for running workflows, getting results, etc.
- Application: Coordination of domain objects and workflow lifecycle management.
- Domain: Core business logic including the engine, context, task, etc.
- Infrastructure: Utility functions and base components.
- Nodes: Implementation of different node types and their executors.
- Interface: Type definitions and interfaces.
